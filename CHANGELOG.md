### Fixed

- Backup: make `backup init --dry-run` return a dry-run payload without writing config, creating a repo, or touching the configured remote.
- Backup: make `backup init --no-push` initialize a local-only repo when no remote is explicitly provided instead of cloning the default remote.

- Sheets: infer `sheets format --format-fields` from `--format-json` when callers do not need a custom mask.
- Sheets: return usage exit code 2 for missing or invalid `sheets update` and `sheets append` values instead of reporting them as generic runtime failures.

- YouTube: return an empty JSON array, not null, when list responses contain no items.

## 0.20.0 - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- Gmail: keep label IDs case-sensitive during label resolution and duplicate-name checks while still matching label names case-insensitively.
- Gmail: clarify that `gmail drafts delete` permanently deletes drafts and cannot be recovered. (#656, #659) — thanks @chrischall.
- Sheets: add `--inherit-from-before` to `sheets insert` so callers can choose whether inserted rows/columns inherit formatting from the preceding or following neighbor. (#655, #658) — thanks @chrischall.
- Sheets: add `sheets copy-paste` / `fill` for range-level CopyPasteRequest fills of values, formulas, formatting, and related paste types. (#661, #663) — thanks @chrischall.
- CLI: add `--enable-commands-exact` / `GOG_ENABLE_COMMANDS_EXACT` for strict command allowlists without prefix expansion. (#652) — thanks @jason-allen-oneal.
- Auth: update stored OAuth scope metadata from observed granted scopes during refresh so `auth list` reflects newly usable services. (#649)
- Docs: preserve paragraph-separating blank lines when replacing a single tab from Markdown. (#644)
- Docs: add `docs cell-update` for non-destructive table-cell content replacement by table, row, and column. (#646)
- Docs: add `docs update --markdown` and `--replace-range` for formatted insertion and range replacement. (#642) — thanks @rel.
- Gmail: pause watch push Gmail API fetches per account while a 429 Retry-After circuit is open. (#643)
- YouTube: let `videos list` and `comments list` use OAuth when `--account` is supplied, preserving the API-key fallback for unauthenticated public reads. (#664)
- YouTube: add `youtube search list` / `yt search ls` for YouTube Data API search across videos, channels, and playlists. (#650, #651) — thanks @BRO3886.
- Gmail: add `gmail search --from-contact` to resolve a contact's email addresses into a `from:(...)` OR query. (#657) — thanks @chrischall.
- Docs: add named `--page-size` presets for `docs write` and `docs page-layout`. (#640) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: add smart-chip insertion commands for person, Drive file, and date chips. (#638) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: add `docs cell-style` for table-cell background color and inline cell text styling. (#645) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: add `docs insert-image` to upload a local image, temporarily share it for Docs insertion, and revoke the public permission afterward. (#648) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: update the bundled `gog` agent skill to preserve broad user OAuth scopes during reauth and rely on command guards for scoped execution.

## 0.19.0 - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Auth: store Google OAuth `client_secret` values in the keyring by default while leaving only client metadata on disk; legacy plaintext credentials still read and `auth credentials set --insecure` preserves the old write shape. (#596)
- Auth: add `auth credentials set --expand-env` for strict environment placeholder expansion in OAuth client JSON. (#599)
- Auth: let `auth import` seed an initial access token and expiry, and round-trip cached access tokens through token export/import. (#598)
- CLI: add XDG kind-aware config/data/state/cache paths with `GOG_HOME`, per-kind `GOG_*_DIR` overrides, and `--home` while preserving legacy auth/keyring/service-account reads. (#621, #622) — thanks @alexminza.
- Docs: add explicit `--page-width`, `--page-height`, and page margin flags to `docs write` and `docs page-layout`, keeping `--pageless` width unchanged unless requested. (#629, #630) — thanks @sebsnyk.

### Fixed

- People: fall back to token identity when `gog me` / `gog whoami` hit a disabled People API on the OAuth client project. (#460, #461)
- Docs: drop all-whitespace Markdown table header rows during Docs markdown writes, and rewrite same-document `#heading-slug` links to native Google Docs heading links after Drive markdown import. (#632, #633) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Gmail: include attachment metadata in `gmail messages search --include-body --json` results. (#620)
- Auth: let `auth service-account set` read service account keys from stdin (`--key=-` or `--key-stdin`) or an environment variable (`--key-env`). (#600)
- Auth: serialize file-keyring reads and writes with a shared lock so concurrent `gog` processes cannot observe partial keyring entries or clobber multi-key token updates. (#597)
- Release: verify the OpenClaw Homebrew tap checkout when checking `gogcli` formula assets.

## 0.18.0 - 2026-05-22

### Added

- Docs: add `VISION.md` with project fit, discussion, and live-test merge guidance.
- Calendar: add --with-zoom / --regenerate-zoom / --remove-zoom that create, regenerate, and remove Zoom meetings and attach the join URL + meeting ID + passcode to the Calendar event description. Google's Calendar API rejects conferenceData writes asserting `conferenceSolution.key.type="addOn"` from non-Workspace-Marketplace OAuth clients, so the description-mode integration is the path that round-trips through Google's storage; trade-off is no native "Join with Zoom" conference card. (#589, #590) — thanks @alexisperumal and @mvanhorn.
- Auth: add gog zoom auth setup / doctor for Zoom S2S OAuth credential storage. (#590) — thanks @mvanhorn.
- Drive: add `--action=resolve|reopen` to `drive comments reply` and sibling `drive comments resolve|reopen` verbs (also `docs comments reopen`) to post a reply that atomically flips the parent comment's resolved state via the Drive API's `Reply.action` field. Avoids the previous workaround of `drive comments delete` (which destroys review-thread context) for batch-resolving inline doc-review feedback. (#623) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Sheets: add `gog sheets batch-update <spreadsheetId> --data-json ...` for updating multiple value ranges in one Sheets API request. Alias: `batch`. (#601) — thanks @Tsopic.
- Docs: add `gog docs insert-page-break <docId> [--index N | --at-end] [--tab=STRING]` to insert a Google Docs page break directly via `InsertPageBreakRequest` — markdown has no native page-break construct, so this is the only path for multi-page deliverables. Aliases: `page-break`, `pb`. (#604)
- Docs: add `gog docs page-layout <docId> [--layout=pageless|pages]` to toggle the page layout of an existing Google Doc via `updateDocumentStyle` on `documentFormat.documentMode`. Sibling to the existing `--pageless` flag on `docs create`/`write`/`update` for the case where the doc was created upstream (e.g. by Drive markdown conversion) without the desired layout. Defaults to `pageless`. Aliases: `set-page-layout`, `page-setup`. (#593)
- Docs: add `--heading-level N` (1..6 shortcut) and `--named-style NAME` (full enum) to `gog docs format` so existing paragraphs can be promoted to `HEADING_1`..`HEADING_6`, `TITLE`, `SUBTITLE`, or `NORMAL_TEXT`. Both set `paragraphStyle.namedStyleType` on the existing UpdateParagraphStyle request and compose cleanly with `--alignment` / `--line-spacing`. (#605)
- Sheets: add `gog sheets reorder-tab <spreadsheetId> --tab=<name|sheetId> --to=N` to move a tab to a specific 0-based position via `updateSheetProperties` with field mask `index`. `--tab` accepts a title or a numeric sheet ID; `--to=0` is force-sent so the leftmost target reaches the wire as `"index":0`. Aliases: `move-tab`, `reorder-sheet`, `move-sheet`. (#603)
- Docs: add `gog docs insert-table <docId> --rows N --cols M [--index N | --at-end] [--values-json [[...]]] [--tab=STRING]` to insert a native Google Docs table directly via `InsertTableRequest`, bypassing the markdown writer. `--values-json` takes a JSON 2D string array whose dimensions must match `--rows`x`--cols`. Empty `--values-json` produces an empty table structure. (#602)
- Docs: `gog docs write --replace --markdown --tab=<tab>` now performs a whole-tab re-render — the targeted tab's existing body is wiped via `DeleteContentRange` and the markdown is re-rendered locally via the same Docs `batchUpdate` path used by `--append --markdown`, so other tabs are untouched. Previously this combination errored because Drive's markdown converter operates on entire documents only. (#595)

### Fixed

- Docs: make generated command references ignore local keyring config so `make ci` stays clean across developer machines.
- CLI: harden backup writes, config/credentials atomic saves, keyring write verification, line input buffering, disabled-API hints, JSON transform number handling, and untrusted-content wrapping after ClawPatch review.
- CLI: bound retry request replay buffering, recover failed async backup pushes, ignore global git commit signing in backup snapshots, and protect account manager OAuth redirects with CSRF checks.
- Release: update the Homebrew handoff to publish through `openclaw/tap`.
- Version: `gog --version` now reports an informative fallback (for example, `v0.17.0-dev`) when built from source with plain `go build` instead of returning `dev`.
- Docs: `gog docs insert` now defaults to end-of-doc when `--index` is omitted, instead of always inserting at position 1 (which silently reversed iterative inserts across multiple calls). Pass `--index 1` explicitly to keep the previous behaviour. (#606)
- Docs: `docs write --append --markdown` with three or more markdown tables in a single render no longer drifts the per-table insertion offset by one character per table — the trailing punctuation of the paragraph immediately before the third (and any subsequent) table is preserved instead of being split into a standalone paragraph after the table. (#607)
- Docs: `docs write --append --markdown` now expands inline markdown markers (`**bold**`, `*italic*`, `` `code` ``, `[link](url)`) inside table cells into character runs, matching the behaviour outside of tables — previously the markers rendered as literal characters because the table inserter bypassed the inline-formatting pass. (#608)
- Docs: markdown empty-header table rows (e.g. `|   |   |`) no longer collide with the separator detection — previously `docs write --append --markdown` swallowed both the empty header and the real `|---|---|` separator, leaving the last data row re-parsed as a literal pipe paragraph after the table. (#609)
- Docs: `docs write --append --markdown` no longer silently drops tables with `insert native table: table not found near index N`. The native-table inserter's post-write search used a ±2 code-unit window, but the Docs API's actual table StartIndex can drift further (auto-newline + placeholder paragraph combine to a several-unit shift); the search now picks the closest forward Table element with matching dimensions and a small backward tolerance instead. The `docs create --file --markdown` path was unaffected because it uses Drive's native markdown import end-to-end. (#592) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- Docs: `docs write --append --markdown` now renders bullet lists as native `BULLET` paragraphs (via `CreateParagraphBullets`) and fenced code blocks as a single contiguous shaded paragraph (joining lines with vertical-tab soft breaks). Previously bullets came through as `NORMAL_TEXT` paragraphs with a literal `•` glyph in the text run, and each code-block line became its own one-line `Courier New` paragraph with no paragraph-level background. (#594) — thanks @sebsnyk.

## 0.17.0 - 2026-05-15

### Added

- `slides create-from-markdown`: import slidey-flavored decks with per-slide YAML frontmatter (`layout:`, `content:`), `## Notes` speaker notes, Font Awesome icon shortcodes, mermaid diagrams, `::cols::`/`::col2::`/`::col3::`/`::right::` columns, and `::boxes::`/`::arrows::` icon-row blocks. New flags: `--fa-style`, `--mmdc`, `--strict`, `--keep-temp-images`, `--no-notes` — thanks @njreid.
- Calendar: add `calendar events --sort=start|end|summary|calendar` and `--order=asc|desc` so `--all` output can be returned chronologically across calendars instead of per-calendar API iteration order. Also documents `now` in the `--from`/`--to` help strings (already accepted by `timeparse`) — the relative form agents need when planning "from now on" — thanks @gado-ships-it.
- Calendar: add `calendar events --location` to include event locations in table output. Embedded newlines in the location string are collapsed so multi-line addresses still render on one row — thanks @gado-ships-it.
- Auth: add `gog auth import --client --email` with `--refresh-token-stdin`, `--refresh-token-file`, or `--refresh-token-env` for non-interactive token import without exposing secrets in argv — thanks @jcarnegie.
- Drive: add `drive share --notify` for invite targets that require a Drive notification email.
- Calendar: keep `calendar appointments` as an explicit diagnostic because the Calendar API still rejects `eventTypes=appointmentSchedule`. (#329)
- CLI: add nested `docs tabs ...` and `forms questions ...` aliases for consistent sub-item command patterns while preserving existing flat commands. (#433)
- Drive: add `drive audit sharing|user` plus guarded `drive bulk remove-public|update-role` permission operations with dry-run and confirmation support. (#336)
- Drive: add `drive labels file list|apply|remove` alongside Drive Labels API v2 discovery. (#339)
- Maps: add directions, distance matrix, geocode, and reverse-geocode commands alongside Places search/details. (#571)
- Photos: add read-only `photos list|search|get|download` for app-created Google Photos media. (#381)

### Fixed

- CLI: make mutating dry-runs for contacts, Docs, Drive, Meet, and Slides stop before auth/API calls while still validating local inputs; harden live smoke tests for self-sharing, disabled Meet, Gmail filter labels, and forced batch deletes.
- CLI: make `drive upload`, `drive bulk remove-public/update-role`, `calendar subscribe`, `docs clear`, `slides create-from-markdown`, `slides insert-text`, `slides replace-text`, `auth tokens import`, and Gmail tracking key rotation dry-runs use the standard parseable dry-run envelope without auth/API access.
- CLI: keep additional Docs write/update/delete/format/find-replace, Drive mkdir/changes, Gmail label create/modify, and Slides add/delete/replace/update-notes dry-runs offline before auth/API calls.
- CLI: give destructive Classroom, Gmail, Keep, and Tasks dry-runs stable JSON operation names and structured request payloads instead of prose `op` values with null requests.
- CLI: keep Docs tab edits, Sheets tab deletes, Drive deletes, comment deletes, auth removals, Gmail delegate/watch removals, Classroom guardian deletes, and other-contact deletes dry-run parseable without auth/API access.
- CLI: make dry-runs for Gmail label edits, Sheets table deletes, Sheets banding/conditional clears, and Forms deletes stop before auth/API calls, and make Forms dry-runs validate choice, scale, quiz, and empty update inputs locally.
- CLI: make dry-runs for Calendar secondary calendars, Forms create/publish/watch/move, Gmail label delete, Sheets table append/clear, Sheets named-range edits, Apps Script create, and Slides template creation stay offline before auth/API calls.
- Calendar: keep `calendar create/update --dry-run` with `--location-search` or `--place-id` offline before Places API lookup while still validating the requested lookup.
- CLI: make dry-runs for Admin group/user/org-unit edits, Contacts delete, Docs tab export, Drive tab download/share/unshare, and Gmail watch renew stay offline before auth/API calls; redact Admin user create passwords in dry-run output.
- Auth: keep fresh OAuth saves working even when old file-keyring token entries are unreadable, and clarify that `--services all` means all user OAuth services while Workspace-only services use service accounts.
- Auth: include Chat reaction scopes in `--services chat` and keep the generated auth scope table freshness-tested.
- Auth: keep the accounts manager bound to loopback addresses, generate callback URLs from the actual listener host, and avoid deleting renamed-account tokens before replacements are stored.
- Gmail: reject off-palette `gmail labels style` colors locally instead of forwarding an opaque Gmail API error.
- Drive: make `drive share --dry-run` stop before permission creation for user and domain shares, including `--notify`.
- Forms: make `forms create --description` apply the description with a follow-up batch update, and preserve zero-valued indexes in `forms move-question`.
- Analytics: show Analytics Admin/Data API enablement hints instead of an Admin SDK hint for GA API-disabled errors.
- Docs: make `docs find-replace --format markdown` strip inline and block Markdown markers while preserving nested bold/italic/code/link formatting in the inserted Google Doc content. (#586) — thanks @sebsnyk.
- YouTube: preserve API-key authentication when wrapping requests with the retry transport, so public `youtube`/`yt` reads no longer fail as unregistered callers. (#578) — thanks @adityarya24.
- Docs: update OAuth success/accounts GitHub links to the `openclaw/gogcli` repository. (#561)

## 0.16.0 - 2026-05-10

(#313) — thanks @satputekuldip.
- Forms: add quiz grading flags to `forms add-question` so choice and short-answer questions can set answer keys and point values when created. (#570) — thanks @dbernaltbn.

- Admin: retry the post-create state update so `admin users create --suspended` and `--archived` remain reliable while the Admin SDK finishes provisioning the new user.
- Calendar: make `calendar update --with-meet` idempotent when an event already has conference data, add explicit `--regenerate-meet`, and show `recurringEventId` in plain event output. (#576 / #573) — thanks @alexisperumal and @NodeJSmith.
- Release: fail closed when macOS signing secrets are missing and verify Darwin release assets are not ad-hoc signed, so Homebrew upgrades keep stable Keychain trust. (#569) — thanks @aaroneden.
- Auth: list one row per OAuth client when the same account is authorized under multiple clients, and let `auth list --client` filter that token bucket. (#563) — thanks @UnPractical91.

## 0.15.0 - 2026-05-05

### Added
- Export exact Google API JSON when the normal CLI view is too lossy: `docs raw`, `sheets raw`, `slides raw`, `drive raw`, `gmail raw`, `calendar raw`, `people raw`, `contacts raw`, `tasks raw`, and `forms raw`, with `--pretty`, safer Drive defaults, Sheets grid-data warnings, and a raw-output security audit. (#495, #496) — thanks @karbassi.
- Audit Drive storage without changing files: `drive tree`, `drive du`, and `drive inventory` now report folder contents, sizes, and inventory data for cleanup/review workflows. (#116) — thanks @rohan-patnaik.
- Find duplicate contacts safely: `contacts dedupe` is preview-only, matches by email/phone by default, supports opt-in name matching, and emits JSON/table merge plans without applying changes. (#116) — thanks @rohan-patnaik.
- Read Gmail messages in agent-safe form: `gmail get --sanitize-content` / `--safe` and `gmail thread get --sanitize-content` return sanitized content without exposing raw Gmail payloads in JSON. (#238, #220) — thanks @urasmutlu.
- Ship official container images: release tags now publish a non-root GHCR Docker image, with file-keyring docs for container automation. (#539, #444) — thanks @HuckOps and @rdehuyss.
- Request custom Drive fields: `drive ls --fields` and `drive get --fields` pass Drive API field masks for data beyond the default JSON set. (#495) — thanks @karbassi.
- Format Google Docs from the CLI: `docs format` and plain-text `docs write` formatting flags cover fonts, colors, bold/italic/underline/strikethrough, alignment, and line spacing. (#479) — thanks @mmaghsoodnia.

- Export Gmail filters as Gmail WebUI-importable Atom XML, while keeping API JSON export via `--format json`. (#174) — thanks @gwpl.
- Build safer agent binaries with baked `agent-safe`, `readonly`, and `full` safety profiles, fail-closed command filtering, filtered help/schema output, docs, and build tooling. (#366, #239) — thanks @drewburchfield.
- Use gog from coding agents more safely with the bundled `gog` skill for JSON-first Google Workspace automation. (#353, #451) — thanks @TimPietrusky and @sluramod.

### Fixed
- Make full-mailbox backups survive large Gmail exports by promoting completed checkpoint shards into the final manifest and byte-splitting fallback message shards before GitHub rejects oversized blobs.
- Make backup exports more resumable and fault-tolerant by streaming decrypted shards, preserving Gmail Markdown mirrors, handling very large JSONL rows, and writing Markdown fallbacks for malformed MIME messages instead of aborting.
- Keep agent safety profiles harder to patch by compiling baked policies into generated hash switches instead of embedding raw allow/deny YAML strings. (#540) — thanks @drewburchfield.
- Show correct versions for `go install ...@tag` binaries by inferring module versions from Go build info when linker metadata is absent. (#545, #544) — thanks @joshavant.
- Accept the documented `calendar events list` / `ls` selector forms, including positional calendar IDs, `--cal`, `--calendars`, and `--all`. (#546) — thanks @BCudeOpenClaw.
- Keep `docs find-replace --dry-run` read-only while still reporting match counts, and allow empty replacement strings to delete matches safely. (#542) — thanks @chrismdp.

## 0.14.0 - 2026-04-28

### Added
- Backup: add `gog backup` with age-encrypted Git shards, Gmail labels/raw message export, Calendar/Contacts/Tasks/Drive metadata adapters, manifest status, full decrypt-and-verify, shard `cat`, local plaintext export, docs, and security-focused regression coverage.
- Backup: expand `gog backup push --services all` with Drive content export/download, Gmail settings, native Workspace Docs/Sheets/Slides/Form data, Apps Script projects, Chat, Classroom, best-effort optional service error shards, and plaintext Drive file export.
- Backup: extend `--services all` with Drive permissions/comments/revisions, Calendar ACL/settings/colors, contact groups, Cloud Identity groups, Workspace Admin Directory users/groups/members, Keep notes, and local Gmail message caching for resumable full-mailbox fetches.
- Backup: add `gog backup export --gmail-format markdown` for local readable Gmail mirrors with Markdown notes and extracted attachment files.
- Gmail: add `gmail messages search --body-format html` for returning HTML message bodies when `--include-body` is used. (#520) — thanks @alexknowshtml.
- Contacts: add `contacts export` for vCard 4.0 `.vcf` exports by resource, email/name search, or all contacts, including best-effort label categories. (#519, #500) — thanks @dinakars777.
- Docs: add experimental `docs export --tab` / `drive download --tab` to export a single Google Docs tab as PDF, DOCX, text, Markdown, or HTML. (#535) — thanks @johnbenjaminlewis.
- Slides: add `slides insert-text` and `slides replace-text` for editing existing slide text elements and replacing template tokens. (#521) — thanks @chrissanchez-iops.
- Drive: add `drive search --drive` and `--parent` for scoping search to a shared drive or folder. (#525) — thanks @LeanSheng.
- Calendar: add `--start-timezone` / `--end-timezone` to `calendar create` and `calendar update` for preserving named IANA event timezones when RFC3339 inputs only carry numeric offsets. (#422)
- Contacts: include birthdays in `contacts list` and `contacts search` text and JSON output. (#441)
- Auth: add `gog auth doctor` to diagnose keyring backend/password drift, unreadable file-keyring tokens, and refresh-token failures such as Workspace `invalid_rapt`. (#377, #338)
- Backup: bound individual Drive content exports with `--drive-content-timeout` so one stuck Google export records an encrypted error row instead of blocking the full backup.
- Backup: add Gmail message-list checkpoints, streaming shard construction, and stderr progress counters so full-mailbox backups can resume cleanly after interruption without keeping every raw message in RAM.
- Backup: push encrypted incomplete Gmail checkpoint commits during long cached fetches so day-scale mailbox backups have offsite progress before the final manifest is committed.
- Backup: push Gmail checkpoint commits through a single ordered background queue so cached fetches continue while GitHub uploads run.
- Slides docs: document the Markdown structure accepted by `slides create-from-markdown`. (#497)

- Auth: store Google OIDC `sub` claims with OAuth tokens and migrate matching subject-keyed accounts when a Google email rename is reauthorized. (#504)
- Gmail: build outbound `Date` headers with the configured timezone so replies do not inherit a wrong host-local offset. (#514, #472) — thanks @dinakars777.

- Gmail: fall back to the People profile name for primary-account `From` headers when Gmail send-as settings omit a display name. (#431) — thanks @moeedahmed.
- Gmail: expose reply threading headers in default `gmail get --format metadata` output and fail explicit reply targets that cannot provide a `Message-ID`. (#528, #512) — thanks @solomonneas.
- Gmail: apply Gmail system-label filters for searches like `in:spam is:unread` so thread, message, and batch message searches do not return read spam. (#449)
- Gmail: preserve renewed watch expiration fields when a long-running `gmail watch serve` process records push delivery state after `gmail watch renew` runs separately. (#526)
- Gmail: reuse the shared paginated list runner for thread and message search so `--all`, `--page`, text, and JSON output stay consistent.
- Gmail: clarify that `gmail batch delete` is permanent and point default-scope workflows at `gmail trash`. (#151)
- Drive/Docs/Sheets/Slides: treat `--out -` as stdout for downloads and exports instead of creating `-`/`-.ext` files; reject `--json --out -` to keep byte streams parseable. (#286)
- Docs: deprecate editing-command `--tab-id` in favor of `--tab`, and resolve tab titles to canonical tab IDs before mutations. (#533) — thanks @johnbenjaminlewis.
- Docs: convert Markdown formatting for `docs write --append --markdown` instead of appending raw Markdown syntax. (#530, #272) — thanks @eric-x-liu.
- Docs: include available tab names when `docs cat --tab` / structure lookup cannot find the requested tab. (#532) — thanks @johnbenjaminlewis.
- Docs: size remote Markdown images consistently for `docs write --replace --markdown` by reusing the Docs image insertion path after Drive conversion, and return a clear error for local image paths that the Docs API cannot fetch directly. (#518) — thanks @vinothd-oai.
- Drive: print large upload progress to stderr while keeping JSON output parseable. (#529)
- Drive: include `hasThumbnail` and `thumbnailLink` in `drive ls`, `drive search`, and `drive get` JSON responses. (#486) — thanks @gtapps.
- Drive: include `driveId` in `drive ls`, `drive search`, and `drive get` field masks so Shared Drive files can be identified in JSON output. (#524) — thanks @LeanSheng.
- Calendar: display `calendar events` times and JSON local fields in the calendar timezone instead of preserving arbitrary event offsets. (#493)
- Email tracking: add versioned tracking-key rotation so new pixels use the current key while old tracking ids keep decrypting through prior keys. (#293)
- Email tracking: deduplicate repeated pixel opens and cap recorded opens per IP per hour to reduce D1 abuse from replay or high-volume requests. (#294)
- Email tracking: add daily Worker retention cleanup for open rows older than 90 days and cap admin `/opens` responses at 500 rows. (#292)
- Email tracking: make `gmail track setup --deploy` reusable with existing D1 databases and valid temporary Wrangler configs.
- Backup: split Gmail checkpoint commits by row count and plaintext byte size so large messages stay below GitHub's blob limit.
- Secrets: time out macOS Keychain read/write/list operations with a clear recovery hint instead of hanging indefinitely when a permission prompt cannot surface. (#515, #513) — thanks @sardoru.
- Secrets: encode file-backend key names so stored tokens work on Windows, while still reading/removing legacy raw entries. (#527, #502) — thanks @solomonneas.
- CLI: show direct Google Cloud API enablement links and matching `auth add --services ...` hints when Google returns API-not-enabled errors.
- Install docs: document Windows release ZIP/PATH setup and clarify that source builds require the Go version declared in `go.mod`, not Ubuntu 24.04's Go 1.22 package. (#157, #135)
- Auth docs: clarify that consumer Gmail refresh tokens expire after 7 days when the OAuth app remains External + Testing, and that publishing the personal OAuth app is the long-lived-token path. (#121)
- CI: pin GitHub Actions workflow dependencies to immutable commit SHAs. (#288)

- Auth: persist rotated OAuth refresh tokens returned during API calls so later commands keep working without re-auth. (#373) — thanks @joshp123.
- Auth: allow pure service-account mode when the configured subject matches the service account itself, instead of forcing domain-wide delegation impersonation. (#399) — thanks @carrotRakko.
- Auth: keep Keep-only service-account fallback isolated to Keep commands so other Google services do not accidentally pick it up. (#414) — thanks @jgwesterlund.
- Auth: add `--gmail-scope full|readonly`, and disable `include_granted_scopes` for readonly/limited auth requests to avoid Drive/Gmail scope accumulation. (#113) — thanks @salmonumbrella.

- Gmail: `gmail archive|read|unread|trash` convenience commands now honor `--dry-run` and emit action-specific dry-run ops. (#385) — thanks @yeager.
- Gmail: retry transient `failedPrecondition` errors during `gmail filters create` and return the existing matching filter on duplicate creates, so reruns stay idempotent.
- Sheets: harden `sheets format` against `boarders` typo (JSON and field mask), with clearer error messages. (#284) — thanks @nilzzzzzz.
- Sheets: force-send empty note values so `sheets update-note --note ''` reliably clears notes via the API. (#341) — thanks @Shehryar.
- Contacts: send the required `copyMask` when deleting "other contacts", avoiding People API 400 errors. (#384) — thanks @rbansal42.
- Groups: include required label filters in transitive group searches so `groups list` doesn’t 400 on Cloud Identity. (#315) — thanks @salmonumbrella.
- Sheets: make `sheets metadata --plain` emit real TSV tab delimiters, with regression coverage for plain tabular sheet output. (#298) — thanks @mahsumaktas.
- CLI: show root help instead of a parse error when `gog` is run with no arguments. (#342) — thanks @cstenglein.
- CLI: include the current partial token in fish shell completion so `gog __complete` sees the active word under the cursor. (#123) — thanks @GiGurra.

- Colorized output in rich TTY (`--color=auto|always|never`), automatically disabled for JSON output.
- Gmail features:
  - Search threads, show thread, generate web URLs.
  - Label listing/get (including counts) and thread label modify.
  - Send mail (supports reply headers + attachments).
  - Drafts: list/get/create/send/delete.

- Contacts / People API features:
  - Contacts list/search/get/create/update/delete.
  - “Other contacts” list/search.
  - Workspace directory list/search (Workspace accounts only).
- Developer experience:
  - Formatting via `gofumpt` + `goimports` (and `gofmt` implicitly) using `make fmt` / `make fmt-check`.
  - Linting via pinned `golangci-lint` with repo config.
  - Tests using stdlib `testing` + `httptest`, with steadily increased unit coverage.
  - GitHub Actions CI running format checks, tests, and lint.
  - `make` builds `./bin/gog` for local dev (`make && ./bin/gog auth add you@gmail.com`).

### Notes / Known Limitations

- Importing tokens into macOS Keychain may require a local (GUI) session; headless/SSH sessions can fail due to Keychain user-interaction restrictions.
- Workspace directory commands require a Google Workspace account; `@gmail.com` accounts will not work for directory endpoints.
