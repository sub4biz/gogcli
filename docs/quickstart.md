# Quickstart

Five minutes from a clean machine to authenticated Gmail, Calendar, and Drive
queries. For a deeper look at OAuth clients, service accounts, and named
profiles, read [Auth Clients](auth-clients.md) after this.

## 1. Install

```bash
brew install openclaw/tap/gogcli
gog --version
```

Other options (Docker, Windows ZIPs, source builds) are documented on
[Install](install.md).

## 2. Get an OAuth client

For guided setup, inspect or execute the common `gcloud` path:

```bash
gog auth setup you@gmail.com --gcloud-project my-gog-project --enable-apis --open-console
```

Add `--create-project` to create that project after confirmation. After downloading the
Desktop OAuth client JSON, one command can store it and start authorization:

```bash
gog auth setup you@gmail.com --gcloud-project my-gog-project \
  --credentials ~/Downloads/client_secret_*.json --login
```

Use `--dry-run --json --no-input` to inspect the complete plan without creating a project,
enabling APIs, storing credentials, opening a browser, or starting OAuth.

`gog` talks to Google APIs as you, using your own Cloud project. The one-time
setup is:

1. Open <https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate> and create a project.
2. Enable the APIs you intend to use: Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets,
   Slides, Forms, Apps Script, People (Contacts), Tasks, Classroom — whatever
   you actually need. The [API library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library)
   is the fastest way to enable several at once.
3. Configure the [OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/branding)
   for "External" + your email; that is enough for personal use.
4. Create a **Desktop app** OAuth client at
   <https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/clients> and download the JSON.

Personal `gmail.com` accounts work for normal user APIs (Gmail, Calendar,
Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms, Apps Script, Contacts/People, Tasks,
Classroom). Workspace-only APIs (Admin Directory, Cloud Identity Groups, Chat,
Keep with domain-wide delegation) require a managed domain — see
[Auth Clients](auth-clients.md).

> **Avoid weekly reauthorization:** External + Testing OAuth apps issue refresh
> tokens for user-data scopes that expire after seven days. In the same Cloud
> project, open [Audience](https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience), click
> **Publish app**, then **Confirm**. This changes the app to In production; it
> does not submit the app for verification. If you already authorized in
> Testing, re-run `gog auth add` once with the same services and
> `--force-consent`. Personal unverified apps can run In production, but
> sensitive scopes show a warning and remain subject to the lifetime 100-user
> cap. See Google's [expiration rules](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2#expiration)
> and [unverified-app limits](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/7454865).

## 3. Store the OAuth client

```bash
gog auth credentials ~/Downloads/client_secret_*.json
```

The file is copied to your per-user config (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gogcli/` or the
OS-equivalent) with mode `0600`.

## 4. Authorize an account

```bash
gog auth add you@gmail.com --services gmail,calendar,drive,docs,sheets,contacts
```

A browser tab opens, you grant the requested scopes, and `gog` stores a
refresh token in your OS keyring (Keychain on macOS, Secret Service on Linux,
Credential Manager on Windows). Headless? Add `--manual` for a paste-the-URL
flow, or `--remote --step 1`/`--step 2` for fully split server runs.

Installed-app authorization uses S256 PKCE. Complete a manual or remote flow
with the same `gog` home and client that generated its URL. After upgrading
from a pre-PKCE release, restart any unfinished flow at step 1.

Verify:

```bash
gog auth list --check
gog auth doctor --check
```

## 5. Set a default account

```bash
export GOG_ACCOUNT=you@gmail.com
# or persist a default with gog auth alias
gog auth alias set default you@gmail.com
```

Now you can drop `--account` from every command.

## 6. Run real commands

```bash
# Gmail
gog gmail search 'newer_than:7d' --max 10
gog gmail get <messageId> --sanitize-content --json

# Calendar
gog calendar events --today
gog calendar create --summary "Review" \
  --from "2026-05-06T10:00:00+02:00" \
  --to   "2026-05-06T10:30:00+02:00"

# Drive
gog drive ls --max 20
gog drive tree --parent <folderId> --depth 2
gog drive du   --parent <folderId> --max 20 --json
gog drive shortcut create <fileId> --parent <folderId>

# Docs / Sheets / Slides
gog docs cat <docId> --tab "Notes"
gog sheets get <spreadsheetId> 'Sheet1!A1:D20' --json
gog slides create-from-markdown "Weekly update" --content-file slides.md

# Profile
gog me
```

`--json` produces a stable JSON envelope on stdout; `--plain` produces TSV.
Human-facing progress, hints, and warnings always go to stderr, so pipes stay
parseable.

Workspace admins can create users and manage organizational units after
configuring Admin SDK access and domain-wide delegation:

```bash
gog --account admin@example.com admin users create ada@example.com \
  --first-name Ada \
  --last-name Lovelace \
  --change-password

gog --account admin@example.com admin orgunits list --type all
```

Cloud Identity Groups also require the Workspace service account and the
`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-identity.groups.readonly` delegated
scope:

```bash
gog --account admin@example.com groups list
```

With an explicit access token or `GOG_AUTH_MODE=adc`, `groups list` and Groups
backups also need `--account <workspace-email>` for their transitive membership
search. `groups members` can use the active principal without that flag.
`calendar team` uses the same Groups auth boundary. These Cloud Identity
lookups do not fall back to stored user OAuth.

See [Workspace Admin](workspace-admin.md) for service-account setup, generated
passwords, recovery fields, organizational units, and cleanup commands.

## 7. Shell completion (optional)

```bash
gog completion bash    >> ~/.bash_completion
gog completion zsh     >  "${fpath[1]}/_gog"
gog completion fish    >  ~/.config/fish/completions/gog.fish
```

  and list Workspace users, organizational units, and groups.
- [Safety Profiles](safety-profiles.md) — runtime allow/deny lists and baked
