# Gmail Workflows

read_when:
- Working with Gmail content, filters, watches, labels, or agent-safe reads.
- Reviewing Gmail commands that cross from read-only into send or modify flows.

Gmail is one of gog's broadest surfaces. Use command-specific pages for exact
flags, and use this page to choose the right workflow shape.

## Search and Read

```bash
gog gmail search 'newer_than:7d' --max 10 --json
gog gmail get <messageId> --json
gog gmail thread get <threadId> --json
```

For agents, logs, or issue reports, prefer sanitized content:

```bash
gog gmail get <messageId> --sanitize-content --json
gog gmail thread get <threadId> --sanitize-content --json
```

`--sanitize-content` strips unsafe/raw payload details while keeping useful
message text for automation.

## Filters

Export filters as Gmail WebUI-compatible XML:

```bash
gog gmail settings filters export --out filters.xml
```

Keep API JSON when a script needs the Gmail API shape:

```bash
gog gmail settings filters export --format json --json
```

Command pages:

- [`gog gmail settings filters export`](commands/gog-gmail-settings-filters-export.md)
- [`gog gmail settings filters list`](commands/gog-gmail-settings-filters-list.md)
- [`gog gmail settings filters create`](commands/gog-gmail-settings-filters-create.md)
- [`gog gmail settings filters delete`](commands/gog-gmail-settings-filters-delete.md)

## Send Guardrails

Block send operations globally for one run:

```bash
gog --gmail-no-send gmail send --to you@example.com --subject test --body body
```

Or use the environment variable in agent shells:

```bash
export GOG_GMAIL_NO_SEND=1
```

For account-specific send blocking, use the no-send config commands:

- [`gog config no-send set`](commands/gog-config-no-send-set.md)
- [`gog config no-send list`](commands/gog-config-no-send-list.md)
- [`gog config no-send remove`](commands/gog-config-no-send-remove.md)

## Reply and Reply All

The Gmail API has no reply method. Clients fetch the original message, build a
complete RFC MIME message, and call `messages.send`. Use the first-class reply
commands so gog owns that composition work:

```bash
gog gmail reply <messageId> --body-file reply.txt
gog gmail reply-all <messageId> --body-file reply.txt \
  --bcc '"Introducer" <introducer@example.com>'
```

Reply defaults match normal Gmail composition:

- The original subject is inherited with one `Re:` prefix.
- The original message is quoted; use `--no-quote` to omit it.
- `reply` targets `Reply-To` when present, otherwise `From`.
- `reply-all` also carries forward original To/Cc recipients while excluding
  the active account and its send-as aliases.
- Display names are preserved.
- CID-backed inline images referenced by quoted HTML are fetched and rebuilt
  as `multipart/related`. If a referenced MIME part is missing, the command
  fails instead of sending broken images.

Recipient flags modify the derived recipient set. `--to`, `--cc`, and `--bcc`
are additive; naming an inherited recipient in a different field moves it
there. Repeat `--remove` to subtract recipients from every field:

```bash
gog gmail reply-all <messageId> --body "Thanks all" \
  --bcc introducer@example.com \
  --remove former-participant@example.com
```

An explicit `--subject` override is supported. A changed subject cannot meet
Gmail's thread-matching requirement, so gog keeps the RFC reply headers but
does not force the original `threadId`; Gmail creates a new conversation.

Remote HTTP images remain remote references. Only MIME parts referenced with
`cid:` are copied into the outgoing message.

`gmail send --reply-to-message-id` remains available as lower-level
composition. It now inherits an omitted subject, but its explicit `--to` and
`--cc` values retain replacement semantics and quoting remains opt-in. Prefer
`gmail reply` or `gmail reply-all` for ordinary replies.

## Attachment Confirmation

`gmail send --json` and `gmail drafts create|update --json` include an
`attachments` array when the resulting message contains attachments:

```json
{"attachments":[{"filename":"report.pdf","size":2411233}]}
```

Sizes are reported in bytes. Draft updates report preserved attachments when
`--attach` is omitted; `--clear-attachments` removes them and omits the field.

## Watches and Pub/Sub

Gmail watch/PubSub workflows are documented in [Gmail watch](watch.md).

Key command pages:

- [`gog gmail watch start`](commands/gog-gmail-settings-watch-start.md)
- [`gog gmail watch serve`](commands/gog-gmail-settings-watch-serve.md)
- [`gog gmail watch pull`](commands/gog-gmail-settings-watch-pull.md)
- [`gog gmail watch renew`](commands/gog-gmail-settings-watch-renew.md)
- [`gog gmail history`](commands/gog-gmail-history.md)

## Email Tracking

Open tracking is documented in [Email Tracking](email-tracking.md) and
[Email Tracking Worker](email-tracking-worker.md).

## Raw Gmail

Use [`gog gmail raw`](commands/gog-gmail-raw.md) when you need the underlying
Gmail API `Message` object. See [Raw API Dumps](raw-api.md) for safety notes.
